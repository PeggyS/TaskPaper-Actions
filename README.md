# TaskPaper Actions
A set of python scripts, URL schemes and launcher workflows to aid in working with elaborate TaskPaper projects

## Feature List
- Marks every subtask as @done if the parent task is @done;
- Marks every task as @done if all it's subtasks are @done;
- Displays the next actions, disregarding @done tasks and subtasks;

## Roadmap
- Rather than display the next actions, tag them with @next. Tag also any corresponding subtask so that it will appear in search;
- Determine next action for a specific project, based on user input;
- Revision mode?
