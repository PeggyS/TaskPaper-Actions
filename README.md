# TaskPaper Actions
A set of python scripts, URL schemes and launcher workflows to aid in working with elaborate TaskPaper projects

## Feature List
- Marks every subtask as `@done` if the parent task is `@done`;
- Marks every task as `@done` if all it's subtasks are `@done`;
- <s>Displays the next actions, disregarding `@done` tasks and subtasks;</s>
- Appends `@next` to next actions.

## Roadmap
- <s>Rather than display the next actions, tag them with `@next. Tag also any corresponding subtask so that it will appear in search;</s>
- Determine next action for a specific project, based on user input;
- Revision mode?
